I wrote this post while I was trying to get some rest from geopolitics research and learning a cool "yet-another-new" web-framework Astro. Mostly it builds the static content from Markdown files as Hugo, Gatsby, Vitepress, etc. 

I have few photos because it is not the right place and time to relax and enjoy what you see. I just took some photos mostly to send my parents.

Hajj starts long before the actual Hajj date. Especially if you are haven't been to Saudia Arabia before.

I will not use any names and show any face in photos just to be on the safe side but I am sincerely grateful to all our brothers and sisters who we went to perform the hajj together. May Allah accept from you and from me.

When I was talking to one of the hajj agency managers they said that they have really nice hotels and I said I want to perform my hajj I don't need a fancy hotel but it turned out that "nice" hotels are the ones that are close to Haram in Mecca.

In 2023, the packages from Germany started from around 7,000 Euro till 10,000 (I might be slightly wrong). The cheapest packages had hotels in Mecca that were a bit far from Kaaba, like 5-8 kilometers, which really can be unconvenient if you choose to stay longer than 10 days. Sometimes you need to go pray in jamaat in Haram and then go back to the hotel. and... Well, in Ramadan or Hajj season the Haram area is so full that getting inside the mosque and finding a place to sit might take up to 1 hour even after reaching the Clock Tower. I've applied for a package from Berlin for 20 days (3 in Medina and 17 in Mecca). Our hotel in Mecca was Voco Hotel which is 30 minute on foot from Haram and they have shuttles every 15 minutes or so. 

Our group was split into two parts, German-speakers and Arabic-speakers and none of them I can understand properly but I've already researched and prepared for the rituals so it was fine. And we had some really good sheikhs, Alhamdulillah, one is an imam from Berlin, originally from Palestine, and a senior sheikh from Morocco for the Arabic group. I would say almost half of the group were Indonesians, German-Turkish people, some people from Tunisia, Bangladesh, and one American convert who lives in Germany now.

### Medina

When we land in Medina and exit the flight, a hot air strikes your face that feels like opening an oven door. And this grilling weather and scorching sun stayed with us till the last day of the trip. We were extra lucky this year because Hajj season was 27th June-3rd July. It was 42-45 during the day and 27-32 at night. The only place you can get rest is the buildings and buses with full-blast air-conditioning. It was my first time living in a desert so I got sick quiet fast.

Our hotel in Medina was right beside Prophet Muhammad's Mosque and the first thing I saw in from the window of my room was a giant construction site on the new wing of the Haram area and the famous umbrellas saving Muslims under their shade.

Another thing you notice is the portraits of the kings on the walls and the logo of "Vision 2030" is absolutely everywhere, on the uniform of masjid workers, on the construction fences and even on Zam-Zam water bottles. Literally the half of Medina is under construction.

They are destroying the whole blocks with old houses, even destroying the mountains stone by stone and building new hotels everywhere. In 10 years, if they finish the constructions, Medina will be unrecognizable. As I understand, "Vision 2030" is an attempt of MBS to make Saudi Arabia less-dependent on oil. Saudi is trying to get more investors' money from abroad, making the Arabia attractive to average European and American tourists by building skyscrapers, selling alcohol, inviting dj's, Shakira and throwing big pathetic music parties. As Sami Hamdi says, the thinking of MBS might be right but the way he is trying to reach that goal contradicts what the Quran and Sunnah says. I personally think following the path of Dubai is a serious mistake. Yes there are a lot of investment opportunities, people do buy apartments there but what are these places turning into afterwards? I saw recently a group where a Russian-speaking real estate agency was advertising to buy apartments in a new complex near Dubai in an emirate that will have "the first casino!". May Allah protect our holy lands.

The indeed did a good attempt to make the planning and infrastructure of Mecca and Medina safe and comfortable. At least it is much better than before the times where there were fatal stulpede..... 
When it comes to skyscrapers and mega projects like the Neom line city, they of course does little sense with all the hunger and poverty in Yemen and African countries in constant tribal wars funded by multiple "civilized" countries in order to be able to buy rear metals for a cheap price.

### The Mosque of the Prophet Muhammad SAW (Masjid Al-Nabawi)

Medina is just schoen. It is so nice and relaxing in Medina. There is Allah's blessing in the atmosphere and always reminded me of the hadith when Abu Bakr was sick in Medina and wrote a poem about their home Mecca, the prophet Muhammad SAW made dua asking Allah to make Medina move enjoyable than Mecca.

You definitely better do all your shopping here in Medina because, first of all, it is cheaper maybe by 20-30% (acc to my estimations), and secondly, in Mecca, there is no time for shopping, you need to do your job.

And the roads in Medina are named after the sahabis, and of course the modern kings. 

<img src="/images/hajj/medina-cats.jpg">

Local desert cats have long legs and look really thin. Usually hiding in the shadows. Other than cats, I've seen only pigeons, doves and crickets; eagles in Macca and camels here and there on the way to Mecca. Some kind of locusts were flying in swarms around Haram lamps. Probably insects are attracted by cool air and moisture from pulverizers in the Haram area. I've prayed several times on the roof of Masjid Al Haram in Mecca and in the morning and after maghrib, there were birds flying above the mosque. There was no time to look for local animals though.

### Bus from Medina to Mecca

On the road to Mecca there were 4-5 control chek points where they would count people in the bus. My friend said they are making sure there are no non-Muslims. Sometimes they would give us a bottle of Zam-Zam. Don't drink it though, keep it as a gift.

On the way to Mecca we chanted Labaik Allahuma Labaik for some time. I still get shivers when I hear Labaik. And we stopped to pray Maghrib in the middle of nowhere in the desert. There was only one mosque and a couple of buildings. and the red sunset.

Ya Rabb, I feel like I've wrote so much and Hajj has not even started yet.

### Umrah

Before I went on this journey, I've spent almost a year researching, reading about the rituals, training to wear ihram, etc. What I did not expect was that the Mecca itself would blow my mind so much that I did my first umrah in a shocked state. 

As I said, it was my first time in Mecca and my first impression of Mecca was absolutely shocking. 

After a long bus ride, we arrived at the hotel probably at around midnight, took a shower and went to perform the umrah right away. I've decided to go with the group to be on the safe side. Along the way there were crowds and crowds of sweaty Muslims from all over the world going towards or from the Haram. The scenes of poor large groups of African brothers and sisters sleeping and eating on the ground shook me. And step by step getting through the crowd we were approaching the Clock Tower. It was difficult to raise my head to see where it ends and walk at the same time. I remember it well. It was noisy and my ear functions started to kind of shut off, the sounds felt weirdly muffled. Security guards and men in ihram everywhere. We entered through the nearest gates, I think it was Bab Al-Salam. After some time sheikh told us to look down and raise our eyes to Kaaba and make a dua. 

Everybody who've been there knows how it feels to do the tawaf around the Kaaba. I used to watch Mecca Live sometimes and on the screen with the smooth Quran recitation the Tawaf on the screen looks so calm and relaxing. In reality, the first time it was the total oppsite, there is so much chaos on the ground floor. But soon you start to adjust and just follow the flow. Our sheikh guided us, we tried to keep the group together and surround the women of the group to keep them safer.

As usual, we prayed behind Maqam Ibrahim after finishing the 7 rounds and drank some Zamzam. That was a good Zamzam. Alhamdulillah.

We did the sai between Safa and Marwa I think on the 2 floor and I don't quiet remember how it was.

After finishing the rituals, while we were getting out of Haram, the athan started so we prayed Fajr. People were exhausted. We went to a building with shops that were fully working even though it was about 4am and got our heads shaved. Our sheikhs said don't pay more than 10 Riyals. The rest I don't remember, I just remember I still hasn't recovered from the shock. We reached the hotel and fell into our beds.

### Waiting for Hajj to Start

AFter performing Umrah we still had almost a week before the beginning of Hajj. These days we've spent 

A few days after Umrah I got sick. Probably was the reaction of my body to what was happening around and of course the AC. By the end of hajj almost everyone I knew got sick. and 80% of people were coughing. At the beginning I was happy that I got sick before the Hajj date thinking that I will recover before Mina but I was sick till the very end of the trip. I knew that everybody gets sick there but I didn't expect it to last that long.

### Mina

When you go to Umrah or Hajj, you are accepting an invitation of Allah into His House. 

Hajj starts when you leave for Mina.



I don't have any photos of Arafat. It was too heavy

Mecca Life and reality




and when I was circulating around Kaaba for the second time, I imagined myself as a companion of angels who













Labaik Allahuma labaik.
I personally think it is a great phrase to say on your death bed. Here I am, oh Lord. I hear your call and I come. But of course it is our obligation to die upon shahada if we can. And of course our beloved prophet Muhammad SAW was the best to choose words when he died. repeating "the companionship of The Most High, the companionship of The Most High".
